Goal: Add a gelPercent: Double property with default 2.0 to GelRenderView, and thread it to the y-mapping (we’ll implement the math next).

Actions:

1. In GelRenderView, add let gelPercent: Double. Default to 2.0 to avoid breaking call sites.

2. Update any initializers/previews.

3. Wherever the y-mapping happens, pass gelPercent into the helper (you’ll add the helper in the next prompt).

Deliverable: Build still succeeds; behavior unchanged for now.
