Goal: Add a user-adjustable gel percentage control (0.8–3.0%) and pass it into GelRenderView. Keep the same nav title and background.

Actions:

1. Open GelView.swift.

2. Add @State private var gelPercent: Double = 2.0.

3. Replace the current body so the top shows a slider + quick presets; below that, render GelRenderView(fragments: fragments, gelPercent: gelPercent).

4. If the file still renders ASCII via gelText, remove that and any onAppear(generateGel) usage.

Patch (minimal, safe):

Slider range: 0.8...3.0, step 0.1.

Segmented quick picks: [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0].

Keep accessibility label/value intact.
