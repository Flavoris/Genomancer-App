Goal: Actually use gelPercent when computing y for every band and lightly adjust band thickness.

Actions:

1. In GelRenderView, where you compute minBP, maxBP, top, and height, replace your y(for:) with:

func y(_ bp: Int) -> CGFloat {
    GelLayout.y(bp: bp, minBP: minBP, maxBP: maxBP, yTop: top, height: height, gelPercent: gelPercent)
}


2. Update the band coreHeight to shrink slightly at higher %:

let gelScale = max(0.8, 1.1 - 0.08 * (gelPercent - 1.5)) // ≈ 1.1 at 1%, ≈ 1.0 at 1.5%, ≈ 0.94 at 2.5%, ≈ 0.90 at 3%
let coreHeight = max(3, (8 - CGFloat(f.length).squareRoot()/30) * gelScale)


3. Build & run; adjust slider/segments and watch bands shift realistically.
