Apply to: GelLayout.swift (top tunables)
Goal: Make default spacing saner without calibration.

Change:

- private static let alpha: Double = 0.48
- private static let k0: Double = -0.05
- private static let k1: Double =  0.22
+ private static let alpha: Double = 0.40   // slightly flatter size-dependence
+ private static let k0: Double = -0.02
+ private static let k1: Double =  0.18    // gentler % slow-down growth with size


You can revert once you calibrate against a real ladder.
