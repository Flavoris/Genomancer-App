Task 9.7 — QA: real-world regression assertions
Add more tests:
- Mixed digest: EcoRI + PstI on a 1.5–3 kb toy sequence.
- Assert boundary positions, overhang lengths, and that incompatible pairs fail `compatibleConcrete`.
- Assert theoretical compatibility for known pairs (e.g., NheI/XbaI 5'-CTAG overhang).
