Task 12.1 — Golden parity tests
From your Python simulator, generate golden outputs for:
- 2 linear sequences × 3 enzyme sets
- 1 circular plasmid × 3 enzyme sets
For each, assert: fragment lengths, boundary positions (sorted), overhang types, and a sticky-end compatibility matrix for 2–3 representative pairs.

Add these as XCTests in `DigestCoreTests`.
