Goal: Make the renderer tunable and test the mapping math.

Actions:

1. Add

enum GelStyle { case photo, cartoon }


to GelRenderView with a style: GelStyle = .photo property.

.photo: stronger halo, higher core opacity.

.cartoon: lower halo radius, slightly thicker bands, slightly higher label contrast.
Use switch style to tweak the constants used in Prompts 3–5.

2. Keep (or improve) accessibility: expose a summary of top bands via accessibilityValue. Reuse the summary logic from your current GelView for consistency. 

GelView

3. Create a tiny pure-Swift helper GelLayout.swift with:

struct GelLayout {
    static func y(bp: Int, minBP: Int, maxBP: Int, top: CGFloat, height: CGFloat) -> CGFloat { /* semi-log */ }
}


so we can unit-test the math without SwiftUI.

4. In the test target, add GelLayoutTests.swift with XCTest cases:

y(maxBP) ≈ top

y(minBP) ≈ top + height

Monotonicity for a few bp values.

Deliverable: tunable look + verified mapping.
