Goal: Make bands look more realistic: thickness and brightness vary.

Actions:

Sort fragments descending by length before drawing (bigger fragments appear higher).

Band thickness rule of thumb:

coreHeight = max(4, 8 - sqrt(bp)/30) (smaller bp → slightly thinner).

If your Fragment includes any mass/quantity field, scale opacity linearly into [0.25, 0.9]. If not, approximate intensity by min(0.9, 0.25 + log10(bp)/6).

Draw bands as rounded rects with cornerRadius = coreHeight/2.

Deliverable: visually varied bands with plausible thickness and intensity.
