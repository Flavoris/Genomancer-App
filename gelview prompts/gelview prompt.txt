Goal: Add a new SwiftUI view GelRenderView that draws a gel lane with no glow yet, plus a simple feature flag in GelView to switch between ASCII and the new renderer.

Actions:

Create Sources/Features/Gel/GelRenderView.swift with a minimal SwiftUI Canvas that draws a dark background, a single lane rect, and accepts [Fragment]. For now, don’t compute positions—just show an empty lane.

In GelView.swift, add @State private var useNewGel = true and conditionally render GelRenderView(fragments: fragments) when the flag is true; otherwise keep the existing Text(gelText). Keep the existing .onAppear(generateGel) only when useNewGel == false.

Implementation details:

Lane width ~110pt, centered, with 24pt vertical padding.

Background color: close to .genomancerBackground.

Navigation title remains unchanged.

Patch: Implement clean, documented code. No glow yet, no labels yet.
