Goal: Implement size→y mapping for fragments using a semi-log transform and lay them out within the lane.

Actions:

In GelRenderView, add a private function that maps base pairs to y-position using:

y(bp) = top + (1 - (log10(bp)-log10(minBP)) / (log10(maxBP)-log10(minBP))) * height


Clamp bp≥1.

Within the Canvas draw phase, compute minBP, maxBP from fragments.map(\.length).

For now, draw each band as a rounded rect (height 6pt) across the lane’s inner width (lane minus 16pt padding), positioned at y(bp). Fill with .white.opacity(0.35).

Keep code structured: a small drawBands(context:size:laneRect:) helper is ideal.
