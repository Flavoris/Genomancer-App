Goal: One workspace with a Swift package (DigestCore) + iOS app (Genomancer).

Create an Xcode workspace named `Genomancer`.
Inside it, add:
- A Swift Package named `DigestCore` (iOS 16+, Swift 5.9+).
- An iOS app target named `Genomancer` using SwiftUI, iOS 16+.
Make the app target depend on the package `DigestCore`.

Project structure:
DigestCore/
  Sources/DigestCore/ (source files go here)
  Tests/DigestCoreTests/
Genomancer/
  App/ (SwiftUI files)
  Resources/ (assets and bundled JSON)

Ensure the app builds (it can be a blank ContentView initially).


Checkpoint: Clean build succeeds.
