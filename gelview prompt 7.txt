Goal: Make the new renderer the default and retire ASCII.

Actions:

1. In GelView.swift, delete gelText state, generateGel(), and .onAppear(perform: generateGel). Replace the ScrollView + Text with GelRenderView(fragments: fragments, style: .photo) (or .cartoon). Keep title and background the same.

2. Remove any unused helpers/constants related to the ASCII gel.

3. Build & run; fix warnings.

Deliverable: clean, modern gel view with the glow bands.
